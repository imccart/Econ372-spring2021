## Slides

The slides for this module are available online as HTML files. The goal of this module is to answer the key questions that anyone should want answered when they start to learn something new, "what, why, who, and how?". That is, "what are we learning and why?", "who is learning it?", and "how are we going to learn it?" 

The module is divided into subsections aligning with these core questions, each with its own set of slides. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the embedded slides and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.
