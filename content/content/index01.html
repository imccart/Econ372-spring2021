<p>Each class session has a et of required readings that you should complete <strong><em>before</em></strong> watching the lecture.</p>
<p>Every class session also has a YouTube playlist of short recorded videos for each of the lecture sections. The lecture slides are special HTML files made with the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html"><strong>xaringan</strong></a> (R can do so much!). On each class session page youâ€™ll see buttons for opening the presentation in a new tab or for downloading a PDF of the slides in case you want to print them or store them on your computer:</p>
