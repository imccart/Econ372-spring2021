<p>Throughout the course, we’ll use a handful of elementary concepts from calculus. These basic tools are straightforward and easily mastered. In fact, you have already used calculus when you considered marginal revenue and marginal cost in your other economics classes. Here, I provide some review material to help you get back up-to-speed with the necessary mathematical concepts for this class.</p>
<div id="functions" class="section level2">
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>A function is just a formal way in which inputs (a functions arguments) are converted into an output. For example, a firm’s total revenue (TR) is a function of the amount they produce (Q), such that: <span class="math display">\[TR = TR(Q).\]</span> This means that total revenue depends on <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>, the quantity of product produced and sold. Total cost is also a function of <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[TC = TC(Q).\]</span></p>
<p>As a more explicit example, suppose that the inverse demand for a firm is <span class="math display">\[P = 100 - 0.10Q,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> denotes price and <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> denotes quantity. Since total revenue is the product of price and quantity, we have <span class="math display">\[TR = P \times Q = (100 - 0.10Q) \times Q = 100Q - 0.10Q^2.\]</span> Thus, total revenue is a function of quantity produced and sold.</p>
<p>Some functions are more complicated. Producing health care, for example, requires a hospital or some facility (<span class="math inline">\(x_{1}\)</span>); lots of equipment and medical supplies (<span class="math inline">\(x_{2}\)</span>); and physicians, nurses, and staff (<span class="math inline">\(x_{3}\)</span>). We can write the production function of hospitals as <span class="math display">\[Q = f(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> denotes the “amount” of health care provided and <span class="math inline">\(f()\)</span> represents the production technology that converts inputs into outputs.</p>
