This includes all of our coverage of insurance purchases and insurance markets (risk aversion, the risk premium and willingness to pay, and adverse selection), as well as our coverage of physician agency (agency under fee-for-service payments, capitated payments, and fixed prices).</p>
<p><strong>Details of the exam will be available before January 25th.</strong></p>
