<p>By the end of each week, I want to hear about what you learned and what questions you still have. This provides you a chance to organize your thoughts and better engage with the course content, and it provides me immediate feedback about how the material and examples are landing in class. Note that you are <strong>not</strong> graded on the quality of your writing, your citations, you specific word count, etc. Just put in the effort and youâ€™ll get full credit.</p>
<p>Completing the check-ins is worth <strong>1 point</strong> toward your weekly participation credit.</p>
