<p>Below are basic descriptions of each category of assignments for this semester, including information on how to turn in each assignment as well as grading criteria.</p>
<div id="homework" class="section level2">
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>Please submit all of your homework answers as a PDF through <strong>Canvas</strong>. You can use Word and “print” to PDF, but I also encourage you to use Overleaf, which will help you to easily create PDFs and is much better for writing math-oriented documents. Overleaf is also fully cloud-based, and as an Emory student, you have full access to Overleaf Professional.</p>
<p>Each homework assignment is worth 60 points toward your final grade. Each homework assignment will have 20 individual parts (think 4 or 5 questions each with 4 or 5 individual components), so you should expect each part of each question to be worth 3 points. Each part will be graded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3 points:</strong> Correct answer</li>
<li><strong>2 point2:</strong> Good try and close, but with minor mistakes</li>
<li><strong>1 point:</strong> Incomplete work but an attempt nonetheless</li>
<li><strong>0 points:</strong> No work toward the answer (e.g., completely blank or some initial equation written without any attempt to solve)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="exam" class="section level2">
<h2>Exam</h2>
<p>We only have one exam this semester, and it will cover content from Modules 1 and 2. The exam is worth 60 points toward your final grade.</p>
<p>Details of the exam will be made available before January 25th.</p>
</div>
<div id="project" class="section level2">
<h2>Project</h2>
<p>We do not have a final exam in this class. Instead, we have a final project that asks you to use real data and interpret some summary statistics in the context of the material we’ve covered in class. The final project is due on the date of our final exam, which is May 12th this year. The project is worth 140 points toward your final grade.</p>
<p>Details of the project will be made available before January 25th.</p>
</div>
<div id="participation" class="section level2">
<h2>Participation</h2>
<p>“Participation” in each week will be graded based on how many of the weekly participation elements are submitted, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 points:</strong> Submission of a weekly check-in and completion of in-class “quiz”</li>
<li><strong>1 point:</strong> Submission of the check-in or completion of the quiz, but not both</li>
<li><strong>0 points:</strong> No submission of a check-in and no completion of the quiz</li>
</ul>
<p>You final participation grade in the class is worth 20 points toward your final grade. We have 14 weeks of class this semester, which means you’ll have well over 20 total “participation” points available. So you have some margin for error here.</p>
