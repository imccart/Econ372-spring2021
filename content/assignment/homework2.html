<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This is our second homework assignment of the semester. It covers questions related to physician treatment decisions and asymmetric information.</p>

<div id="questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Assume a physician is operating with the standard profit function, <span class="math inline">\(\pi = (p-c)x\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> reflects a constant marginal cost of production, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> denotes quantity of healthcare provided, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> denotes the price per unit of healthcare provided. Assume also that patients receive some total benefit from care received, reflected by the equation <span class="math inline">\(B(x)=10x - (1/2)x^{2}\)</span>. Patients must pay the full price, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, of any care received, so that the net benefit of care to the patient is then <span class="math inline">\(B(x)-px\)</span> (their total benefit less their costs). Finally, assume that the best outside option for the patient yields a net benefit of 8.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the patient were to choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to maximize their net benefit, what level of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> would they choose?</p></li>
<li><p>Find the physician’s profit maximizing choice of quantity, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. You need to solve this as a function of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>At a marginal cost of <span class="math inline">\(c=2\)</span>, find the physician’s optimal price, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the physician’s profit maximizing choice of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the patient’s optimal choice of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Are these the same? Why or why not?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assume instead that the physician faces a fixed price, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}=4\)</span>. The setup is otherwise identical to question 1.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the patient were to choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to maximize their net benefit, what level of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> would they choose?</p></li>
<li><p>Again assuming <span class="math inline">\(c=2\)</span>, find the physician’s profit maximizing choice of quantity, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Hint: marginal cost doesn’t matter here except to ensure that <span class="math inline">\(c&lt;\bar{p}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>How does the deviation in the physician and patient optima differ from what you found in question 1? Explain your answer in a couple of sentences.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assume now that the physician can affect the number of their patients through their influence on the net benefit (NB) provided to patients. Assume also that the physician faces a fixed price paid by the insurer, denoted <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}\)</span>, along with a capitated payment per patient, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and that the patient faces a price of <span>$</span>0, <span class="math inline">\(p_{d}=0\)</span>. In this extension, the physician’s goal is to choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> so as to maximize profit, <span class="math display">\[\pi = n\left(NB\right) \left[R + (p_{s}-c)x \right].\]</span> Finally, assume the functional forms <span class="math inline">\(n(NB)=\sqrt{NB}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B(x)=10x-x^{2}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the patient’s optimal level of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the first order condition for the physician’s choice of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Don’t try to solve this for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that the physician makes <span>$</span>1 on each quantity of care provided (<span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c=1\)</span>), find the value of the capitated payment, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, such that overtreatment is minimized. Please assume that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can only take discrete values, so that the minimum amount of overtreatment is 1 “unit of care” per patient.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that the physician loses <span>$</span>1 on each quantity of care provided (<span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c=-1\)</span>), find the value of the capitated payment, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, such that undertreatment is minimized. Again, assume that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can only take discrete values, so that the minimum amount of undertreatment is 1 “unit of care” per patient.</p></li>
<li><p>Which scenario (minimizing overtreatment or undertreatment) is better for the physician’s profit.</p></li>
</ul></li>
