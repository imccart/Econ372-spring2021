The final project is a big part of your grade. This essentially replaces what would otherwise be a final exam. Please start as early as possible and save yourself lots of stress in May!


## Overview
Hospital price transparency is an important topic and one that has been at the forefront of health policy debates for many years. Recently (like just now!), CMS mandated that hospitals provide their negotiated payment rates in a "machine-readable" format for patients to be able to see actual hospital prices for selected procedures. For more info on the initiative, see [here](https://www.cms.gov/hospital-price-transparency). 

Building off of this new policy, this project is all about hospital "prices". There are three main elements of the project:

1. Collect data on hospital prices, charges, and Medicare payment rates for select procedures
2. Discuss the differences between these different measures of "price"
3. Examine the implications of a "charge-based" pricing contract versus a "Medicare-based" pricing contract. 

## Project Details {#steps}
Your project analysis should proceed with the following steps:

1. Identify a hospital market in the U.S. that you would like to study. You can find a list of hospital markets on the shared Google Sheet, [econ372-hospital-markets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uMsKWUxqYZb_JAx54A9tpK0pREnVLKf3Xv-vuLuCmkY/edit?usp=sharing). Put your name by the market you'd like to study. This is first-come, first-served, so no one can pick the same market. Once you've selected a market, identify at least 5 hospitals in that market that you will focus on for this project. Among these hospitals, you need to pick at least 2 different "systems." In other words, you can't just pick Emory University Hospital, Emory University Hospital Midtown, Emory Hospital Decatur, etc. List these hospitals along with a brief description of each hospital in the first section of your paper. For example, is the hospital a specialty hospital, or does it have any reputation that you're aware of as a "good" or "bad" hospital in some area?

2. Collect data on the hospitals' charges and negotiated prices. These may be difficult to find, and the data will likely be in different formats across different hospitals. Once you've found the data, paste the link to the file in our [econ372-hospital-markets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uMsKWUxqYZb_JAx54A9tpK0pREnVLKf3Xv-vuLuCmkY/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet. Be sure to paste the link for each hospital (not just one link for a whole market). Here are a couple of hints to help you find these links:

    + According to the CMS final rule files for the price transparency initiative, all of the new pricing files should follow the same naming convention, `<ein>_<hospital-name>_standardcharges.[json|xml|csv]`. `ein` stands for Employer Identification Number. **Note:** Not all hospitals follow this naming convention, so it may take some time to find the right files.
    + Google has several advanced search options that allow you to find all sorts of very specific files. For example, if you wanted to find pdf files linked in a certain url, you would type `filetype:pdf inurl: <url>` directly into the search bar. This will give you a list of results for the links to pdf files within the specific url you provided. **Note:** Google might think you're a robot with these types of searches, so be ready to prove otherwise.

3. Collect data on Medicare payment rates for the same hospitals and same procedures. These data are publicly available from the [Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Inpatient](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient) files.

4. Create a dataset that contains data from 2 and 3. In these data, each row should be a hospital/procedure pair, and the columns should include information such as: "hospital ID"; "DRG code"; "Total discharges"; "gross charge"; "negotiated payment"; and "Medicare payment". Save your dataset as a ".csv" file and include it as part of your project submission.

5. Provide a table of summary values for each hospital. For example, your table could show the mean charge and payments for these procedures by hospital. 

6. Calculate the range of charges, negotiated prices, and Medicare payments across the hospitals in your data. Show these ranges in a figure.

7. Highlight one interesting aspect of your data and discuss this in your report. Support your discussion with at least one figure or table. You get to choose what is "interesting" here. Think of this as summarizing your findings from Q2-Q6 above.

8. Now let's think about how these pricing figures relate to competition. Calculate each hospital's market share and provide a scatterplot of the market share and negotiated payments. Pick whatever procedure you'd like to focus on. In your figure, please highlight the different hospitals in some way (e.g., use different colors for each hospital or different shapes for each plot). 

9. What do you take from these data? Does it seem as if the larger or more powerful hospital has a higher price? Relate these findings to the bargaining model we covered in class, focusing in particular on the notion of the insurer and hospital's outside options. Support your conclusions with at least one peer-reviewed academic paper.

10. Now let's think about contracts. For each hospital in your data, try to determine whether their negotiated prices are more similar to "markup over Medicare" or "percentage of charges". Explain your conclusion and support your determination with a figure or a table. How does this conclusion relate to the hospital's market power?

11. Finally, go find some measure of quality for each hospital. Ideally, these quality measures would be specific to each procedure, but that's likely not possible, so any hospital-level measure of quality will do. This could be patient ratings on Google Reviews, or it could be [official hospital quality measures](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings) from CMS. How do the hospital prices correlate with these quality measues (do they seem to be positively or negatively correlated)? Support your conclusions with at least one peer-reviewed academic paper.

12. Given your knowledge of these prices and all of this analysis, do you think the price transparency initiative will help to reduce hospital prices? Why or why not? Support your conclusions with at least one peer-reviewed academic paper.

13. Reflect on your work. Describe one thing you learned from this process and one area that left you confused or unclear. 

## Formatting and Report Structure {#format}
As with your homework assignments and exam, you will turn in your project via *Canvas*. Your final project must meet the following basic formatting requirements: 

- **Format**: Double-spaced text with clearly defined section headings and subheadings
- **Length**: At least 5 and no more than 10 pages, excluding references, tables, or figures
- **Citations**: At least 3 peer-reviewed academic journal articles
- **Data Visualization**: At least two tables and two figures 

Please organize your final report along the following sections:

1. **Description of your selected market and hospitals**: Relates to Q1 in [Project Details](#steps)
2. **Hospital prices, charges, and Medicare payments**: Relates to Q2-Q7 in [Project Details](#steps)
3. **Pricing and competition**: Relates to Q8-Q10 in [Project Details](#steps)
4. **Pricing and quality**: Relates to Q11 in [Project Details](#steps)
5. **Summary and conclusions**: Relates to Q12-Q13 in [Project Details](#steps)


## Grading Criteria
Your final project grade is based off of 20 points as allocated below. Anything worth 1 point will be graded on a "yes" or "no" basis (no partial credit). Anything worth 2 points will be graded similar to our homework (0 points if the element is missing or submitted with insufficient effort, 1 point for a solid attempt but something major still missing, and 2 points for strong effort and generally accurate work).

- **Follow instructions** (2 points): Does your report meet the requirements for length, formatting, citations, and data visualization?
- **Grammar** (1 point): Does your report have sufficiently few grammatical mistakes, typos, etc.?
- **Pricing data** (1 point): Did you provide the link to the pricing data in our Google Sheet as described in Q2 in [Project Details](#steps).
- **Complete data** (2 points): Did you create and submit the final dataset as described in Q4 in [Project Details](#steps)?
- **Data summary** (2 points): Did you summarize your data as described in Q5 and Q6 in [Project Details](#steps)?
- **Discussion of payments** (2 points): Did you discuss your pricing data as describe in Q7 in [Project Details](#steps)?
