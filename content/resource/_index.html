<p>Here are a few additional resources that you may find helpful throughout the semester. The first is a math practice/review sheet. This is a good way to assess how comfortable you will be with much of the math this semester. If you can complete the review sheet easily, then you should be in good shape for the class. I’ll also include all of our class worksheets on this resources page, so that they are all accessible in one place. Finally, this is where I’ll house any exam review sheets or any other publicly available supplemental material throughout the semester.</p>
